# ardiunobot
Some simple setup code for an arduino robot.

This includes basic movement forwards/backwards. Turning to the left or right 90 degrees, or spinning the wheel individually.

See the comments in the code for usage details. Also be aware that pin mapping is important, so make sure the motor control pins in the arduino match up to the mapping defined in the code - or redefine the mapping to match your configuration.
